Run this in Maya
import rigging.awRig as awrig

AwRig = awrig.awQuickRigger()
print AwRig
AwRig.hierarchy
You can get the Ui like this.
AwRig.UI_()
Basically you import awRig module into the awrig namespace. You now have a unique instance of that module
Then you can assign the awQuickRigger class to a variable
and call any of the methods from that class
